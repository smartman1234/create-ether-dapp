After creating a new repo by using this one as a template, clone your new repo into your IDE of choice.
Once cloned, go into your new cloned repo & run:

```bash
npm install
```

You can also `cd` into all 3 directories (`frontend`, `backend`, & `hardhat`) & run either `yarn install` or `npm install`.

### Running All at the Same Time

You can run the backend, frontend, and local blockchain node all from 1 single terminal instance.
To do so, run the following command from your project's root directory.

```bash
npm dev
```

This utilizes a package called `concurrently` that allows you to concurrently run all instances from a single terminal.
